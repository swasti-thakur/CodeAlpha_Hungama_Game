# CodeAlpha_Hungama_Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game repository! This project is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game, developed using Python. The game randomly selects a word, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time. The game provides a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game is lost.
